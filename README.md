3D-Printing-MediaComp
=====================

I just had an idea I wanted to share with you all. At VT we're starting to have various 3d printers such as the "makerbot" crop up all over campus (of course I understand this is not the case everywhere).  I was just thinking that perhaps this summer, I may write a small mediacomp lesson that I would use after nested looping on images, to do nested looping in a 3d space, and maybe store a simple true or false at each position (essentially a "voxel") and then I'd have to create a little program to take such a 3d list and convert it into whatever format the 3dprinters like (.stl file or whatever)
